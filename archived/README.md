# Archived Files

This folder contains files that are no longer needed in the active codebase but are kept for reference.

## Contents

### Build Artifacts
- `rails_accessibility_testing-*.gem` - Built gem files (these are generated during `gem build` and should not be committed to git)

### OS Files
- `.DS_Store` - macOS system file

### Planning/Verification Documents
- `POTENTIAL_ISSUES.md` - List of potential GitHub issues and enhancements
- `VERIFICATION.md` - Verification checklist for gem components
- `TEST_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive test plan documentation
- `TEST_SUITE_SUMMARY.md` - Test suite summary and verification

These planning documents were useful during development but are now archived as the project has matured.

## Note

These files are kept for historical reference only. They should not be moved back to the root directory.
